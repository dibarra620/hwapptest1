This past week I tried fixing my devise gem to make it work, but ended up getting lost in all of my code, and in the end, the app would not even get up and running. So i started a new project and used the course code to get up to dat up until devise, and at that point everything was working fine.

Then I tried adding the add on (Just SendGrid, no new relic), and that seems to work on my local server. But on heroku it fails after signing in/signing up. It seems to be a problem with 'heroku run rake db:migrate', as that brings up some error when i run it, 'rake db:migrate' works on its own however.
